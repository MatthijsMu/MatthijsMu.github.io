I am a double BSc student in Mathematics and Computer Science at Radboud University. So far I have discovered my interest in algorithms and datastructures, and statistics and probability, numerical methods and analysis. I have also enjoyed some physics courses, in particular advanced mechanics and quantum mechanics. At the moment, I am busy studying my two degrees and getting involved in research via my faculty's honours programme. This november, I received the KHMW Young Talent Award for my outstanding results as a BSc Computing Science student.

Mathematical puzzles have occupied me since longer: I placed 16th in the national finale of the [Dutch Mathematical Olympiad](https://wiskundeolympiade.nl/docenten/info-in-english) (2021). My secondary school project on optimizing blackjack strategies using reinforcement learning was awarded the first prize in the [OMO PWS Contest](https://www.omojaarverslag.nl/verslag2022/f/omoprijzen/omoprijzen-een-bijzondere-motiveringsprijs-voor-leerlingen) (2022). This summer (2023), I was selected for the [Cornell, Maryland, Max Planck Pre-doctoral Research School](https://cmmrs.mpi-sws.org/). This amazing summer school confirmed my passion for research. Next summer, I want to get involved in a research internship.
