I am a BSc student in Mathematics and in Computer Science at Radboud University. I also enjoy Physics courses, which at the moment will remain a minor. At the moment, I am also involved in an extracurricular research-oriented Honours programme. This website is primarily dedicated to study-related things, for example it has a list of course summaries that I made. But I also use it to export some of my pastimes, such as my art.

Some of my past experiences that I am quite proud of: I once participated in the [Dutch Mathematical Olympiad](https://wiskundeolympiade.nl/docenten/info-in-english) (2021), where I got to 16th place in the national finale. I did a secondary school project on optimizing Black Jack strategies using Reinforcement Learning, which was awarded the first prize in the [OMO PWS Contest](https://www.omojaarverslag.nl/verslag2022/f/omoprijzen/omoprijzen-een-bijzondere-motiveringsprijs-voor-leerlingen) (2022). In summer 2023, I got an exclusive look into CS research by participating in the [Cornell, Maryland, Max Planck Pre-doctoral Research School](https://cmmrs.mpi-sws.org/). I had never experienced my area of studies in this way before, and it opened my eyes to the possibilities within scientific research.
