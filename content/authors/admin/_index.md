I am a BSc student in Mathematics and in Computer Science at Radboud University, who is currently enjoying a minor in Physics. At the moment, I am busy studying my two degrees and getting involved in research via my faculty's Honours programme. I always thought I had a preference for applied mathematics, but I am currently really enjoying the more abstract courses, in particular Topology and Measure Theory. 

Mathematical puzzles have occupied me since longer: I once participated in the [Dutch Mathematical Olympiad](https://wiskundeolympiade.nl/docenten/info-in-english) (2021), where I got to 16th place in the national finale. I did a secondary school project on optimizing Black Jack strategies using reinforcement learning, which was awarded the first prize in the [OMO PWS Contest](https://www.omojaarverslag.nl/verslag2022/f/omoprijzen/omoprijzen-een-bijzondere-motiveringsprijs-voor-leerlingen) (2022). This summer (2023), I was selected for the [Cornell, Maryland, Max Planck Pre-doctoral Research School](https://cmmrs.mpi-sws.org/). It was a very inspiring experience where I met many talented and passionate researchers.
