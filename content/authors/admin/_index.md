I am a BSc student in Mathematics and in Computer Science at Radboud University. I also enjoy Physics courses, which at the moment will remain a minor. At the moment, I am also involved in an extracurricular research-oriented Honours programme. This website is primarily dedicated to study-related things, for example it has a list of course summaries that I made. But I also use it to export some of my pastimes, such as drawing \& painting.
