title: Combinatorial Group Theory
summary: |-
  Summary of the course Combinatorial Group Theory at Radboud University. Considers Cayley graphs, free groups, fundamental groups, actions on graphs, Nielsen-Schreier, presentations and knot/link groups. I followed this course in my first year, as a 2nd year's elective.

          Lifting a spanning tree from the quotient graph to the original Cayley graph. 
          This is an essential idea in section 3.1, where we characterize Free Groups as the groups that can act freely on trees."
